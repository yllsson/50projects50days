# 50projects50days

Repo for storing my progress through the 50 Projects 50 Days course.

I may not complete one project every day, but when I do I'll log them here and update my front page with the link.

Day 1 - 04/12/2020 - Expanding Cards
(You won't see the commits for this day as I completed day one before I created this gitHub repo.)

Day 2 - 05/12/2020 - Progress Steps

Day 3 - 06/12/2020 - Rotating Navigation

Day 4 - 08/12/2020 - Hidden Search Widget
